# libft

Welcome to the libft project! The goal of this project is to provide you with a collection of useful functions in C programming language. This library will help you save time and simplify your coding tasks in future projects.

The purpose of this project is to make you understand and implement basic functions that you would typically use in your coding journey. By writing these functions from scratch, you will be able to better understand how they work and be able to use them with confidence.

As you work on this project, you will continually improve and add to your libft library. However, when working on future projects, always be aware of the allowed functions.

The functions in libft will include but are not limited to:
- String manipulation functions
- Memory allocation functions
- Conversion functions
- List functions

We hope that you will enjoy working on this project and that it will provide a solid foundation for your future coding endeavors in C.
